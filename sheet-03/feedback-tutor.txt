Hi Przemyslaw,

here is my feedback for exercise sheet 3. Feel free to contact me if you have
any questions.

# Sheet 3

Total points: 20 / 20


## General feedback

Lean code, everything tested. Nice work. You did not test intersect2, so I did
not correct it. Didn't matter, though, you had enough for 20 points already.

## Exercise 1

Points: 20 / 20


### Ex. 1.1 (10 / 10)

I found the following non-trivial improvements:

* Galloping search
* Sentinels
* Binary Search (implicitely)
* Predictable branches (in intersect2, but untested)

Interesting explanations of your steps, with some surprising results (+ YT
video) :)

You are right, "tricks" like caching .size() for a vector are useless with -O3,
the compiler is smarter than you :) BTW, I thought for a very long time that
size() is actually just returning an internal size_t counter stored in the
std::vector, but no, no such waste of precious memory in the STL - it actually
does a single subtraction:

### Ex. 1.2 (10 / 10)

Done, nice tabular output of results, and results are in the wiki.

### Ex. 1.3 (optional)

The film we were looking for was "The Big Lebowski" by the Coen brothers. The
fact that the rug tied the room together was mentioned 4 times as a statement,
1 time as a question :)
